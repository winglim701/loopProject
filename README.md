# Loop Project
## Basic Java Project

Write a Java program which prints out a count from 1 to 100, than prints the numbers 200-100, and finally prints 10-1000 with only numbers evenly divided by 10. Use the for loop to do these and do not use the % operator. 

Write a Java program which prints  all  even number from 1 to 100, then all odd numbers between 300-400, and finally prints 30-333 with only numbers evenly divided by 3 . Use a while loop for this exercise. You will also want to use an if condition and use the % operator to check if a number % 2 is equal to 0 and print it if that is the case.

Write a Java program which prints  the grade average for a user based on a user supplied set of grade values. Repeat execution until user has no more items to be graded. Use a do while for this exercise. You will also have to use two variables to hold the current accumulated grade points as well as the total number of grades entered so that the average will be totalGradePoints / numTotalGrades. Other things covered in this exercise: Scanner, Integer.parseInt.
